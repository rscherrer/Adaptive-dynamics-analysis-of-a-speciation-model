This is a study of a parapatric speciation model in a sexual organism using adaptive dynamics theory. It was originally supposed to help illustrate that simulations implementing epistatic genetics, from another study, show behaviors that are closer to asexual models of speciation. One option is to use this study as a supplement for the simulations study, as a backup for this claim. Simulations without sexual reproduction, however, could also show the point, and there are many other insights to be derived from the present analysis. Another option is therefore to have it as a separate article. This may be difficult to achieve, because most of the insights covered here are also covered by other authors in the literature (e.g. Bolnick and Kirkpatrick for the stabilizing effect of assortative mating) and our study may lack a strong message. One way to settle this is to do some literature search and see whether our paper could fit somewhere, maybe even on an arxiv platform.
