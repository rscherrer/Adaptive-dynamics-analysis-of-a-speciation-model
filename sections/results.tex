Sexual selection increases the stability of evolutionary equilibria and therefore turns branching points into stable strategies. Shades of grey indicate the highest tested level $\alpha$ of sexual selection at which branching still occurs when a population is initially a specialist of the first resource ($x = -1$). Dashed lines expand the borders of the grey areas to show the full extent of where branching can theoretically occur, irrespective of the starting trait value.}
